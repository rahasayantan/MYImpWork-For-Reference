# This is just the feature engineering portion of FabienDaniel's kernel https://www.kaggle.com/fabiendaniel/detecting-malwares-with-lgbm
# It is essentially the same as my previous kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/malware-feature-engineering-only), 
# but here I tried to transform the ENTIRE train and test files.
# Its purpose is to just do the feature engineering, and save the new FE files so that they can be used 
# by other kernels which just do the modeling part.
